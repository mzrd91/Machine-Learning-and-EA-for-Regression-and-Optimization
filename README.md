# Machine-Learning-and-EA-for-Regression-and-Optimization
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, specifically symbolic regression, and optimization using evolutionary algorithms. The main focus is on the regression problem with different noise scenarios and optimizing a multi-variable function using various libraries and techniques, including DEAP and Platypus.
